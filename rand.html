<p>That one puzzle</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[ \frac{\partial (x^2 + y^2)}{\partial (x + y)} = ? \]</div>
<p>Okay, fine, yes, that one was a joke. But it took me a whole weekend to solve it.</p>
<p>Not that every day isn't a weekend for me, but I remember solving it on Sunday and posing it the day before.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I might not work today :(</p>
<p>... Because there is a science something, what was it again? Physics festival! So I am sad to say that, today, I will break my at least <span class="arithmatex">\(1\)</span> edit to my website per day rule... Wait! This text that I am writing counts as something, so I'll add this to my website. Anyways, I need to leave, and everyone is waiting for me.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Or today.</p>
<p>... That title and this text will be what I add to my website today.</p>

<p>One twig</p>
<p>One twig is a unit of distance, but first, y'know how one meter is one light second (the amount light traveles in one second) divided by <span class="arithmatex">\(299,792,458\)</span>? Well, I was thinking: can't I just make a unit of measurement defined as one light second divided by <span class="arithmatex">\(300,000,000\)</span>? Well, that would be decimal-centric! (I'd rather use binary.) So, I defined one twig (or one absolute unit) as one light second divided by <span class="arithmatex">\(2^{30}\)</span>, so just under one foot, coming in at <span class="arithmatex">\(10.99\)</span> inches. Using twig-ic (I just came up with that name) is a lot like using metric (I was too lazy to invent an imperial like system (even though I'm 'murican) because I could only invent one unit), I was gonna use a binary based systen, but octal was better as it is closer to <span class="arithmatex">\(10\)</span> and is the amount of fingers on a cartoon character. If you divide a twig into <span class="arithmatex">\(8\)</span>, you get <span class="arithmatex">\(1\)</span> unotwig, after that, <span class="arithmatex">\(1\)</span> duotwig, then <span class="arithmatex">\(1\)</span> triotwig, then <span class="arithmatex">\(1\)</span> quadtwig, then <span class="arithmatex">\(1\)</span> pentatwig, then <span class="arithmatex">\(1\)</span> hexatwig, then <span class="arithmatex">\(1\)</span> heptatwig, then <span class="arithmatex">\(1\)</span> octotwig, then <span class="arithmatex">\(1\)</span> nonatwig, then <span class="arithmatex">\(1\)</span> decatwig, then <span class="arithmatex">\(1\)</span> elatwig, but at that point, it is smaller than <span class="arithmatex">\(1/10\)</span>'th of a nanometer, better stop there (also, the prefix is equal to the power of <span class="arithmatex">\(8\)</span> that you are dividing it by). If you want to get bigger units, add the prefix "nega", but when you get to one negaelatwig, it's the size of <span class="arithmatex">\(8\)</span> lightseconds. So yeah, that is the measurement system that I created last night.</p>

<p>Actually, I went to mississippi, then alabama, then florida, then a restauraunt.</p>

<p>We are back in alabama, and we are finaly going to tabconf.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>False alarm, that's today. Plus, tabconf is in georgia</p>

<p>I'm doing my first talk in <span class="arithmatex">\(45\)</span> (ish) minutes</p>

<p>The talk did good, and here it is<a href="">:</a> that is, when it comes out.</p>

<p>.</p>
<p>Announcement!</p>
<p>It's the next day again and, because both the talk that I've been waiting <span class="arithmatex">\(1\)</span> year for (the second one) and the one I've been spending all my free time on for the last week (the first one), I can now come back to working on my website instead of doing daily edits to this page.

<p>I was at a sports party the other day with my sister and some of my friends, and then we decided to make a play together.</p>
<p>I don't remember much about the game, I think it was about Kentucky Fried Chicken vs the golden ratio (KC vs PHI)</p>
<p>I will refer to everyone involved as me, my sister, my friend (male), my friend (female) 6-year-old #1, and 6-year-old #2.</p>
<p>We finished the script for act <span class="arithmatex">\(1\)</span> scene <span class="arithmatex">\(1\)</span>, but then we are given a 2-minute warning, so we had to improv the rest.</p>
<p>We were planning on just showing it to my dad, but all of the adults ended up showing up, and we started.</p>
<p>Now that I actually have to recording, let's start with...</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[ \text{Act } 1 \text{ Scene } 1 \]</div>
<p>Actors: me and my sister as the parents, the two 6-year-olds as the kids.</p>
<p>6-year-old #1: "Why do we have to go to school? Last time we went to school we had to fight a bear!"</p>
<p>6-year-old #2: "Plus, it's so windy outside that the wind will pick us up!"</p>
<p>My sister: "Oh, stop it you! You can stop going to school when you turn <span class="arithmatex">\(18\)</span> or dinosaurs fly!"</p>
<p>My friend (male): * Throws a dinosaur plush across the backyard *</p>
<p>Me: "Ignore that."</p>
<p>My sister: "Well, do you want to know how much it is you need to go to school?"</p>
<p>6-year-old #1: "Yeah!"</p>
<p>My sister: "Well, if you don't go to school, you won't get a job, and if you don't get a job, you'll die alone in a ditch!"</p>
<p>Me: * Loudly whispers to her: "this wasn't in the script!" *</p>
<p>My sister: "You know what we had to do to get to school? Well, let us show you."</p>
<p>At this point I went into the audience because I didn't know what their plan was and I didn't think I was involved. But no one was expected what happened next.</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[ \text{Act } 1 \text{ Scene } 2 \]</div>
<p>Actors: my friend (male) and my friend (female) as the past versions of the parents.</p>
<p>My friend (female): "I'm not doing that pop test no matter what happens!"</p>
<p>My friend (male): "Yes."</p>
<p><span class="arithmatex">\(600\)</span> Lines.</p>
<p>My friend (female): "Oh, my god, I've fallen over."</p>
<p>My friend (male): * Helps her up *</p>
<p>My friend (female): "Tell grandpa I've left the purple toquitos in the freezer!"</p>
<p>*Pause *</p>
<p>My friend (female): "No, I will not march for the queen, I am my own woman!" She said while marching.</p>
<p>*Pause *</p>
<p>My friend (male): * Starts pulling her by the arm *</p>
<p>My friend (female): "You're not taking me anywhere, you * unintelligible *!".</p>
<p>*Pause *</p>
<p>My friend (female): "I don't take orders from goldfish!".</p>
<p>My friend (female): * Falls over *</p>
<p>My friend (male): * Starts pulling her by the arm again *</p>
<p>My friend (male): "Do you have anything to say to say to us!?"</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[ \text{Act } 1 \text{ Scene } 3 \]</div>
<p>New actor: my sister as the school nurse.</p>
<p>My sister: "What is it?"</p>
<p>My friend (male): "Am I a mushroom, * unintelligible *!?"</p>
<p>My sister: "All right, as the school nurse-"</p>
<p>My friend (female): "Do you know any lava personally" (?).</p>
<p>My sister: "As I was saying: as the school nurse, I think we need to call <span class="arithmatex">\(911\)</span> for her."</p>
<p>My friend (male): * Starts calling <span class="arithmatex">\(911\)</span> *</p>
<p>My friend (female): * Screams and runs away *</p>
<p>My sister: "Stop her!"</p>
<p>My friend (male): * Grabs her by the hand and she starts spinning around him. *</p>
<p>My sister: * Grabs her by the other hand as she comes to a stop *</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[ \text{Act } 1 \text{ Scene } 4 \]</div>
<p>My friend (female): "I will not be contained, I am a dinosaur!"</p>
<p>My sister: * Pulls her by the hand and says: "Sit down." *</p>
<p>My sister: "As a dinosaur, it is important for you to rest."</p>
<p>My friend (male) quietly: "No, it's not."</p>
<p>My friend (female): "I am a dinosaur!"</p>
<p>My friend (male): "I am going to * unintelligible *!?"</p>
<p>My sister: "Okay so both of you are a dinosaur."</p>
<p>My friend (male): "Well, no, I'm not a-"</p>
<p>My sister: "What happened to you being a dinosaur? Are you now a panda?"</p>
<p>My friend (male): "Hmm. Both!"</p>
<p>My sister: "So you're a dina-panda."</p>
<p>My friend (male): "There's no such thing as a-"</p>
<p>My sister: "There is now."</p>
<p>My friend (female): "* unintelligible * !"</p>
<p>My friend (male) and my friend (female): * Start fighting for no reason *</p>
<p>My friend (male): "<em> unintelligible </em>!"</p>
<p>My sister: "Oh, gosh!"</p>
<p>My friend (male) and my friend (female): * Stop fighting, cross their arms, and start arguing but are interupted by my sister *</p>
<p>My sister: * Stands up *</p>
<p>My sister: "You need to go to class."</p>
<p>My friend (female): "No, we're not going to class no matter what! We have a pop test today, and y’know, I don't do well with math, so-"</p>
<p>My sister: "Neither do I."</p>
<p>My friend (female): * Walks up closer to her *</p>
<p><span class="arithmatex">\(700\)</span> Lines.</p>
<p>My friend (female): "Neither do I."</p>
<p>My sister: "Good."</p>
<p>*Pause *</p>
<p>My friend (female): "Okay, fine, I'm going to-"</p>
<p>6-year-old #1: * Throws alligator plush at my friend (male)'s face *</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[ \text{Act } 2 \]</div>
<p>My friend (male): * Starts screaming *</p>
<p>My friend (male): "Get it off!"</p>
<p>My friend (male): * Collapses on the floor *</p>
<p>Simultaneously...</p>
<p>Alligator: * Latches onto my friend (female)'s hand *</p>
<p>My friend (female): "Get it off me!"</p>
<p>Alligator: * Falls of *</p>
<p>My friend (female): * Turns around and sees my friend (male) on the floor *</p>
<p>My friend (female): "Oh, he's dead!"</p>
<p>New actors: 6-year-olds as the police that finally showed up.</p>
<p>6-year-olds: * See someone dead on the floor *</p>
<p>6-year-olds: * Start doing CPR on him by pushing on his stomach *</p>
<p>6-year-old #1: * Leaves *</p>
<p>6-year-old #2: * Continues *</p>
<p>My friend (male): * Gets up *</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[ \text{Act } 3 \]</div>
<p>Actors: my friend (male) and my friend (female) as the parents, the two 6-year-olds as the kids.</p>
<p>My friend (female) to my friend (male): "I still can't believe that they aren't going to school!"</p>
<p>6-year-old #1: "We don't even have school!"</p>
<p>My friend (female): "Yes you do!"</p>
<p>*Both parents leave *</p>
<p>New actor: my sister as probably the older sister.</p>
<p>My sister: * Enters *</p>
<p>My sister: "No, summer break hasn't ended yet."</p>
<p>6-year-old #1: "When is it gonna be school then?"</p>
<p>My sister: "Well, it'll be school next week."</p>
<p>6-year-old #1: "Yeees!"</p>
<p>6-year-old #2: "I don't like school."</p>
<p>6-year-old #1: "Me neither."</p>
<p>My friend (female): * Enters *</p>
<p>My friend (female): "Too bad, cuz you have to go, or else the purple toquitos will be soggy!"</p>
<p>*Everyone starts arguing *</p>
<p>The end!</p>
<p>And then most of us lined up and we all bowed at different times, except for me, I didn't bow.</p>

<h4 id="the-craziest-work-week">the craziest work week<a class="headerlink" href="#the-craziest-work-week" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>If you think that you had the craziest work week or busiest schedule, think again! I'll try to add all of these after Monday on the corresponding day. You'll figure out why this is a work week on the <span class="arithmatex">\(7\)</span>th day. Here's one I found in a book:</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[ \text{Sunday} \]</div>
<p>Genesis 1:1</p>
<p><span class="arithmatex">\(1000\)</span> Lines, wow.</p>
<p>First, God created the heavens (up to interpretation) and the earth.</p>
<p>Genesis 1:2</p>
<p>But the Earth was still empty and didn't really have anything interesting on it.</p>
<p>Genesis 1:3</p>
<p>And then God created light.</p>
<p>Genesis 1:4</p>
<p>God saw that the light was good, and separated it from the darkness.</p>
<p>Genesis 1:5</p>
<p>God called the light "day" and the darkness "night". This concludes the first day.</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[ \text{Monday} \]</div>
<p>Genesis 1:6</p>
<p>And then God said "let there be an expanse to separate the water from the water".</p>
<p>Genesis 1:7</p>
<p>And then just that happened, God created an expanse to separate the water above it (probably rain) from the water below it (ocean).</p>
<p>Genesis 1:8</p>
<p>God called the expanse "sky". This concludes the second day.</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[ \text{Tuesday} \]</div>
<p>Genesis 1:9</p>
<p>But the earth still pretty much looked like a ball of water, so God gathered the water revealing dry ground.</p>
<p>Genesis 1:10</p>
<p>God called the dry ground "land" and the gathered waters he called "seas", and God saw that it was good.</p>
<p>Genesis 1:11</p>
<p>And then, on the land, God created vegetation, i.e. seed bearing plants, trees that produce fruit, etc.</p>
<p>Genesis 1:12</p>
<p>And then just that happened, and God saw that it was good.</p>
<p>Genesis 1:13</p>
<p>This concludes the third day.</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[ \text{Wednesday} \]</div>
<p>Genesis 1:14</p>
<p>And then God said "Let there be lights in the sky to be able to tell day, night, days, weeks, seasons, years, etc...".</p>
<p>Genesis 1:15</p>
<p>And then God said "...Also, they should glow".</p>
<p>Genesis 1:16</p>
<p>And then God made just that, two greater lights for the day and night respectively, and and aslo the stars.</p>
<p>Genesis 1:17</p>
<p>And God set them in the sky to give light on the earth...</p>
<p>Genesis 1:18</p>
<p>...To tell day from night, large time frames, etc.</p>
<p>Genesis 1:19</p>
<p>This concludes the fourth day.</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[ \text{Thursday} \]</div>
<p>Genesis 1:20</p>
<p>And then God said "Let there be fishes in the water and birds in the air".</p>
<p>Genesis 1:21</p>
<p>And then God made just that, and God saw that it was good.</p>
<p>Genesis 1:22</p>
<p>And then God blessed them and told them to be fruitful and increase in numbers.</p>
<p>Genesis 1:23</p>
<p>This concludes the fifth day.</p>
<p><span class="arithmatex">\(1100\)</span> Lines.</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[ \text{Friday} \]</div>
<p>Genesis 1:24</p>
<p>And then God said "Let there be livestock, wild animals, and other such creatures that move across the ground".</p>
<p>Genesis 1:25</p>
<p>And then God made just that, and God saw that it was good.</p>
<p>Genesis 1:26</p>
<p>And then God said "Let us make man in our own image, in our own likeness, and let them rule over all of the earth".</p>
<p>Genesis 1:27</p>
<p>And then God made just that, humans male and female.</p>
<p>Genesis 1:28</p>
<p>And then God told them that they have permission to rule over the Earth.</p>
<p>Genesis 1:29</p>
<p>And that they can eat plants and fruit and stuff.</p>
<p>Genesis 1:30</p>
<p>And that God also gave the same permission to animals to eat plants and fruit.</p>
<p>Genesis 1:31</p>
<p>And then God looked out at everything he had created in the past <span class="arithmatex">\(6\)</span> days, and God saw that it was very good. This concludes the sixth day (and chapter <span class="arithmatex">\(1\)</span>).</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[ \text{Saturday} \]</div>
<p>Genesis 2:1</p>
<p>Now the Earth was finally complete.</p>
<p>Genesis 2:2</p>
<p>And then God finally took his weekend after all the work he'd been doing.</p>
<p>Genesis 2:3</p>
<p>And then God blessed saturdays (or really just days of rest) and made them holy.</p>

<p>The brainstorm page is officially turning <span class="arithmatex">\(1\)</span> year old!</p>
<p>How do I know this? Well, partially GitHub commit history, but also because of a tradition / festival that my family celebrates once a year that happened to coincide with eclipse day last year. According to my memories, during this, I created the brainstorm page. The same thing just happened a couple of days ago (it always happens on the weekend), so that's how I know that the page is turning <span class="arithmatex">\(1\)</span>.</p>

<p>Day one of road trip my family left in the morning and I'm currently writing this in the night because we were busy packing up the computer.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Day two of road trip and there is nothing worth of note (PS we had ice cream).</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Day three and my family finally got to see a Bitcoin related thing. The main thing at the party (other than just talking to people) was there was a pool (known as the mempool) and you had to get as many beach balls as you can onto your side of the pool. Whichever team wins gets to move on to the next round. My family got second place.</p>
<p>I was able to explain to one person how to make an 8-bit computer. I explained to someone else what an option is and he said it was the best explanation of the Black Scholes equation he's ever heard (?). And I was able to explain how cubic equations relate to the equation <span class="arithmatex">\((x + y)^3\)</span> and how they relate to a certain puzzle that my family makes.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Day four and we're already leaving.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Actually, on day four we went to btc++ which was an entire bitcoin conference, and because it happened yesterday I don't even remember what the most interesting thing that happened there was, and I was not informed by my family that we were going there until after I wrote down the message, and the next time I got to use a computer was now.</p>

<p>Today, I lectured my dad on counting systems like the complex numbers, split complex numbers, and dual complex numbers, why you never hear about <span class="arithmatex">\(3\)</span>d numbers, and how this all relates to ring theory and geometric algebra.
