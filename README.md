# Silas Maths

All derivations here are painstakingly authored by Silas Pembroke, with a little help from his Dad.

* [Polynomial](polynomial.md) - solving for the roots of the quartic equation
* [Calculus](derivatives.md) - derivative formulas from first principles:
sum rule, chain rule, product rule, multiplication by constant, exponent rule, introduction to $e$, logarithmic derivative, power rule
* [Calculus II](calculus_2.md) - derivations of $e$ and $e^x$ from limits, a derivation of the quotient rule
* [Complex](complex.md) - introduction to complex numbers and their relationship to sine and cosine using geogebra
* [Jacobian](jacobian.md) - on the relation between complex numbers and linear algebra
* [Gamma](gamma.md) - explores the connections between factorials, calculus, and the Gamma function, extending factorials to non-integers
* [Hyperbolic](hyperbolic.md) - Geogebra visualization of hyperbolic arcs
* [Trigonometry](trigonometry.md) - Desmos visualization of angle addition
* [Harmonic](harmonic.md) - On the alternating and non-alternating harmonic seireis. I didn't want to remove the old description made by chatGPT, even if someone might think "more description equals longer page" which is why I replaced it. Here is the old description in quotation marks. "The alternating harmonic series `1 - 1/2 + 1/3 - 1/4 + 1/5 - ...` is restructured by rearranging terms, leading to a new series that converges to a known value. By defining a function `f(n)` that represents the sum of a sequence of fractions, and then extending this to `f(âˆž)`, it's shown that this sum converges to the natural logarithm of 2 (`ln(2)`). Therefore, the infinite alternating harmonic series sums up to `ln(2)`. This conclusion is reached through a creative manipulation of series and leveraging properties of logarithms."
