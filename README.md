# Silas Maths

All derivations here are painstakingly authored by the $11$ yo Silas Pembroke, with a little help from his Dad. He was- I'm all ready tired of talking in the $3$rd person. I am a boy who loves mathematics and would like to share my math with the world.

* [Calculus](derivatives.md) - derivative formulas from first principles:
sum rule, chain rule, product rule, multiplication by constant, exponent rule, introduction to $e$, logarithmic derivative, power rule
* [Polynomial](polynomial.md) - solving for the roots of the quartic equation
* [Calculus II](calculus_2.md) - derivations of $e$ and $e^x$ from limits, a derivation of the quotient rule
* [Complex](complex.md) - introduction to complex numbers and their relationship to sine and cosine using geogebra
* [Jacobian](jacobian.md) - on the relation between complex numbers and linear algebra
* [Gamma](gamma.md) - explores the connections between factorials, calculus, and the Gamma function, extending factorials to non-integers
* [Trigonometry](trigonometry.md) - Desmos visualization of angle addition
* [Harmonic](harmonic.md) - On the alternating and non-alternating harmonic seireis. I didn't want to remove the old description made by ChatGPT, even if someone might think "more description equals longer page" which is why I replaced it. You can read the old description below:

The alternating harmonic series `1 - 1/2 + 1/3 - 1/4 + 1/5 - ...` is restructured by rearranging terms, leading to a new series that converges to a known value. By defining a function `f(n)` that represents the sum of a sequence of fractions, and then extending this to `f(âˆž)`, it's shown that this sum converges to the natural logarithm of 2 (`ln(2)`). Therefore, the infinite alternating harmonic series sums up to `ln(2)`. This conclusion is reached through a creative manipulation of series and leveraging properties of logarithms.

* [Eigenstuff](eigen.md) - the applications and derivations of eigenvectors and eigenvalues
* [Binomial](binomial.md) - a derivation of the binomial theorem, an introduction to discrete calculus, and a method for computing pi (not pie)
* [Fractional calculus](fractional_calculas.md) - an introduction to fractional calculus using cauchy's (other) integral formula
* [Fibonacci](fibbonacci.md) - using the golden ratio phi and the less popular psi to derive binet's formula among other things
* [Probability](probability.md) - a coin flip game leads you into a new job as a detective to test if someone is cheating or not (I haven't added anything to it in a while)
* [Complex II](complex_2.md) - a derivation of the roots of unity, "I'll write this down when I put something in here and surround this text in quotation marks"
* [The strand puzzle](the_strand_puzzle.md) - a popular puzzle from the strand magazine a hundred years ago that ramanujan solved "straight away", whatever that means
* [The infamous "arctan puzzle"](arctan.md) - the other puzzle that I was working on in the vacation
* [Modular arithmetic](mod.md) - if you restart counting after $10$, $5$, or $7$
* [Brainstorming a new page](brainstorm.md) - pretty self explanatory
* [Geometric algebra](geometric_algebra.md) - (secretly clifford algebra) Yes, you can multiply two vectors.

PS you don't get a vector

* [Set theory](set_theory.md) - definitions of the subset, empty set, power set, and so on.
* [Code repo](actual_repo.md) - Pretty self explanatory. Also, the idea for both this page and the one above it did not originate in the brainstorm page.
* [My way to count](binary.md) - why YOU should use binary
* [Geometric algebra 2](geometric_algebra_2.md) - the first part (this page will not make sense without it) crashed
* [Lambda calculus](lambda.md) - an exploration of lambda calculus, the smallest programing language where "functional programing language" is an understatement (based off of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VQ382QG-y4) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAnLQ9jwN-E))
* [Thoughts](rand.md) - The half of the brainstorm page that had nothing to do with math, and everything to do with what was happening at the time.
* [Summer of Math Exposition 4](some4.md) - my submission to [SoME4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojjzXyQCzso) (he didn't have a video for SoME $2$ through $4$)
* [Set theory: logic edition](logic.md) - the set theory page, but derived from the ground up using logic and extensions.
* [Projective geometry](projective_geometry.md) - an introduction to projective geometry where parallel lines cross, and there are two points that lie on every circle.
* [Lambda calculus revisited](lcr.md) - (Lcr) I gave up on this one, but then I came back! It is still heavily based off of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VQ382QG-y4), [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAnLQ9jwN-E), and even more heavily based off of [this](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0804.3434) (Warning: the videos are ~ $1 \text{H}$ long, and the paper has (exactly) $120$ pages).
* [Linear algebra](linear.md) - A course about the more general mathematician's version of linear algebra, the study of vectors (like the strange man with a bowl cut and an orange suit) and matrices (like the fake AI generated simulated reality). But if you want some more intuition about how it works, each chapter will have a corresponding part in [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab)
* [Group theory](group_theory.md) - A page about group theory, an attempt at a grand unified theory of mathematics. I'll be covering things like dihedral groups, symmetric groups, subgroups, cosets, isomorphism, and maybe even the $196,883$ dimensional monster.
