# Silas Maths

All derivations here are painstakingly authored by Silas Pembroke, with a little help from his Dad.

* [Calculus](derivatives.md) - derivative formulas from first principles:
sum rule, chain rule, product rule, multiplication by constant, exponent rule, introduction to $e$, logarithmic derivative, power rule
* [Polynomial](polynomial.md) - solving for the roots of the quartic equation
* [Calculus II](calculus_2.md) - derivations of $e$ and $e^x$ from limits, a derivation of the quotient rule
* [Complex](complex.md) - introduction to complex numbers and their relationship to sine and cosine using geogebra
* [Jacobian](jacobian.md) - on the relation between complex numbers and linear algebra
* [Gamma](gamma.md) - explores the connections between factorials, calculus, and the Gamma function, extending factorials to non-integers
* [Trigonometry](trigonometry.md) - Desmos visualization of angle addition
* [Harmonic](harmonic.md) - On the alternating and non-alternating harmonic seireis. I didn't want to remove the old description made by ChatGPT, even if someone might think "more description equals longer page" which is why I replaced it. Here is the old description in quotation marks. "The alternating harmonic series `1 - 1/2 + 1/3 - 1/4 + 1/5 - ...` is restructured by rearranging terms, leading to a new series that converges to a known value. By defining a function `f(n)` that represents the sum of a sequence of fractions, and then extending this to `f(âˆž)`, it's shown that this sum converges to the natural logarithm of 2 (`ln(2)`). Therefore, the infinite alternating harmonic series sums up to `ln(2)`. This conclusion is reached through a creative manipulation of series and leveraging properties of logarithms."
* [Eigenstuff](eigen.md) - the applications and derivations of eigervectors and eigenvalues
* [Binomial](binomial.md) - a derivation of the binomial therom, an introduction to discrete calculas, and a method for computing pi (not pie)
* [Fractional calculas](fractional_calculas.md) - an introduction to fractional calculas using cauchy's other integral formula
* [Fibbonacci](fibbonacci.md) - using the golden ratio phi and the less popular psi to derive binet's formula among other things
* [Probability](probability.md) - a coin flip game leads you into a new job as a detectave to test if someone is cheating or not (I haven't added anything to it in a while)
* [Complex II](complex_2.md) - a derivation of the roots of unity, "I'll write this down when I put something in here and suround this text in quotation marks"
* [The strand puzzle](the_strand_puzzle.md) - a popular puzzle from the strand magazine a hundred years ago that ramanujan solved "strtaight away", whatever that means
* [The infamous "arctan puzzle"](arctan.md) - the other puzzle that I was working on in the vacation
* [Modular arithmetic](mod.md) - if you restart counting after $10$, $5$, or $7$
* [Brainstorming a new page](brainstorm.md) - pretty self explanatory
* [Secretly clifford algebra](geomatric_algebra.md) - Yes, you can multiply two vectors.

PS you don't get a vector

* [Set theory](set_theory.md) - definitions of the subset, empty set, power set, and so on.
* [NOOOOOOOOOO](streak.md) - I lost evereything.
* [Code repo](actual_repo.md) - pretty self explanatory. Also, the idea for both this page and the one above it did not originate in the brainstorm page.Binary.md](binary.md
* [My way to count](binary.md) - why YOU should use binary
* [Geometric algebra 2](geomatric_algebra_2.md) - the first part crashed
