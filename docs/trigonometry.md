the black triangle in its bottom-left corner has angle $\alpha$ and the blue triangle in its bottom-left corner has angle $\beta$, they are both right triangles, and the length of the top of the blue triangle is 1, and of coarse the combind angle is $\alpha + \beta$

the question is: what is the $sin(\alpha + \beta)$ and $cos(\alpha + \beta)$?

well, the top of the the black triangle/bottom of the blue triangle has length $cos(\beta)$

I'll start with the $sin$, which is the length of the purple line, which is the hight of the upper-black line plus the distance between that and the green line
