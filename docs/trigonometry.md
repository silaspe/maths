by the way, the opposite is the sine times the hypotanuse and the adjasent is the cosine times the hypotanuse

in other words, $opp = sin \cdot hyp$ and $adj = cos \cdot hyp$

the black triangle in its bottom-left corner has angle $\alpha$ and the blue triangle in its bottom-left corner has angle $\beta$, they are both right triangles, and the length of the top of the blue triangle is 1, and of coarse the combind angle is $\alpha + \beta$

the question is: what is the $sin(\alpha + \beta)$ and $cos(\alpha + \beta)$?

I'll start with the $sin$, which is the length of the purple line, which is the length of the purple line below the upper-black line plus the length of the purple line above the upper-black line

the length below is the same as the hight of the right of the black triangle with hypotanuse $cos(\beta)$ which is the opp so $sin(\alpha)cos(\beta)$

the length above is in the top right mini blue triangle with hypotanuse $sin(\beta)$, and I'll leave this as an exersize for the veiwer, but the angle in the top-left is $\alpha$ and its the adj so $cos(\alpha)sin(\beta)$

in total $sin(\alpha + \beta) = cos(\alpha)sin(\beta) + sin(\alpha)cos(\beta)$
