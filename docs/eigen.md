### I want to take a matrix to a large power $n$

if the matrix (I'll call it $A$) is diagonal, in other words if it is of the form below

$$ \begin{bmatrix}
a & 0 & 0 & \dots \\
0 & b & 0 & \dots \\
0 & 0 & c & \dots \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots \\
\end{bmatrix} $$

or because I am assuming $A$ is a $2 \times 2$ matrix, its probably more like

$$ \begin{bmatrix}
a & 0 \\
0 & b \\
\end{bmatrix}$$

than $A^n$ is the matrix below:

$$ \begin{bmatrix}
a^n & 0 \\
0 & b^n \\
\end{bmatrix}$$

but if $A$ is not diagonal, than just switch to a basis (in particular, an eigenbasis that I will dedicate the rest of the page or)

an eigenbasis as it is called, is also just usefull in other cases lke when you need to find the next [fibbonacci number](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPa0FA65Fk), or find the flow in a population of foxes and rabbits (even if you need to see the entire second video) which I will do both of thoes at the end of the page

so the top question is...

### what even is an eigenvector
