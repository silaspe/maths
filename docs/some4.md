First, the things on the left of the screen are not part of the submission. Because it said in the rules "you can't make your submission ahead of time", this page exists. I'll be summarizing the website as of today.

## Calculus

$$ \frac{f(x + dx) - f(x)}{dx} = \frac{df}{dx} = f\prime (x) $$

### sum rule

$$ \vdots $$

$$ (f + g)\prime = f\prime + g\prime $$

### product rule

$$ \vdots $$

$$ (fg)\prime = fg\prime + f\prime g $$

### chain rule

$$ \vdots $$

$$ (f(g))\prime = f\prime(g) g\prime $$

### mbc rule

$$ \vdots $$

$$ (cf)\prime = c f\prime $$

### exponent rule

$$ \vdots $$

$$ \frac{d(a^x)}{dx} = a^x \frac{a^{dx} - 1}{dx} $$

$$ \text{(lets figure this out later!)} $$

### e

$$ \frac{de^x}{dx} = e^x $$

$$ \vdots $$

$$ e = (1 + dx)^{\frac{1}{dx}} $$

$$ log_e (x) = : ln(x) $$

### logarithmic derivitave

$$ \vdots $$

$$ (ln(f))\prime = \frac{f\prime}{f} $$

$$ f(x) = a^x $$

$$ \vdots $$

$$ (a^x)\prime = a^x ln(a) $$

### power rule

$$ f(x) = x^n $$

$$ \vdots $$

$$ (x^n)\prime = n x^{n - 1} $$
