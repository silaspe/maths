The equations below are the beginning of pages that may or may not get added to my website. All pages after Modular arithmetic and this one started here in the brainstorm page. I got these from copying things from a piece of paper that hes potential to become a digital page. And finaly, the titles have a question mark if they are my best guss for the titles of the page, no question mark if I made the page and know the title, and a question mark if I never published the page, but still want the world to see it. Also, happy eclipse day! The eclipse was worth the $10$ (total) hours of driving.

### galois theory/field theory?

A field of numbers is a collection of numbers where you can add, subtract, multiply, and even sometimes divide two numbers (as long as you don't divide by zero) in that field to get another number in that field. For example, the rationals, the reals and the complex numbers ane all fields that are infinate and you can divide them. The complex lattice points (which are complex numbers of the form $integer + integer \cdot i$ ), the matrixes (incert joke here), and the integers, are all in the infinate but can not always be divided. I know what you might be thinking: "what the (abbreviation that I am allowed to say for a curse word that I am not allowed to say) is a non-infinate field?". A non-infinite field or finite field is something like the [modulo numbers](https://silaspe.github.io/maths/mod.html). You might not be able to divide in a non-prime base, but you can do it in a prime base. So that completes the venn diagram!

Today, I want to show you an infinate field where you can not divide, I'm talking (well, typing) about numbers of the form

$$ a + b \sqrt{7} $$

for integers $a$ and $b$
