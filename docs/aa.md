The equations below are the beginning of pages that may or may not get added to my website. All pages after Modular arithmetic and this one started here in the brainstorm page. I got these from copying things from a piece of paper that hes potential to become a digital page. And finaly, the titles have a question mark if they are my best guss for the titles of the page, no question mark if I made the page and know the title, a question mark if I never published the page, but still want the world to see it, and extra small if is just one puzzle, but didn't fit anywhere and/or was worth making a dedicated page. Also, happy eclipse day! The eclipse was worth the $10$ (total) hours of driving.

### galois theory/field theory?

A field of numbers is a collection of numbers where you can add, subtract, multiply, and even sometimes divide two numbers (as long as you don't divide by zero) in that field to get another number in that field. For example, the rationals, the reals and the complex numbers ane all fields that are infinate and you can divide them. The complex lattice points (which are complex numbers of the form $integer + integer \cdot i$ ), the matrixes (incert joke here), and the integers, are all in the infinate but can not always be divided. I know what you might be thinking: "what the (abbreviation that I am allowed to say for a curse word that I am not allowed to say) is a non-infinate field?". A non-infinite field or finite field is something like the [modulo numbers](https://silaspe.github.io/maths/mod.html). You might not be able to divide in a non-prime base, but you can do it in a prime base. So that completes the venn diagram!

Today, I want to show you an infinate field where you can not divide, I'm talking (well, typing) about numbers of the form

$$ a + b \sqrt{7} $$

for integers $a$ and $b$.

Side note! A number of this form can only be written in one way. Not because $\sqrt{7}$ is an imaginary number, but because $\sqrt{7}$ is irrational. End of side note.

You can probably take my word for it that you can add, subtract, and multiply these numbers, but here's a proof (which was the only thing on that was on the paper that inspired this (digital) page. *Other than division and square roots).

$$ (a + b \sqrt{7}) + (c + d \sqrt{7}) = a + b \sqrt{7} + c + d \sqrt{7} $$

$$ (a + b \sqrt{7}) - (c + d \sqrt{7}) = a + b \sqrt{7} - c - d \sqrt{7} $$

$$ (a + b \sqrt{7}) \cdot (c + d \sqrt{7}) = ac + a d \sqrt{7} + b \sqrt{7} c + b \sqrt{7} d \sqrt{7} $$

.

$$ (a + b \sqrt{7}) + (c + d \sqrt{7}) = (a + c) + (b + d) \sqrt{7} $$

$$ (a + b \sqrt{7}) - (c + d \sqrt{7}) = (a - c) + (b - d) \sqrt{7} $$

$$ (a + b \sqrt{7}) \cdot (c + d \sqrt{7}) = (ac + 7bd) + (ad + bc) \sqrt{7} $$

$$ \text{And all of these are a number of this form. The end! Yeah, that was my whole* idea.} $$

#### that one puzzle

$$ \frac{\partial (x^2 + y^2)}{\partial (x + y)} = ? $$

$$ \text{Okay fine, yes, that one was a joke. But it took me a whole weekend to solve.} $$

$$ \text{Not that every day isn't a weekend for me, but I remember solving it on sunday and posing ist the day before.} $$

#### I might not work today (sad emoji)

... Because there is a science something, what was it again? Physics festival! So I am sad to say that, today, I will break my at least $1$ edit to my website per day today... Wait! This text that I am writing counts as something, so I'll add this to my website. Anyways, I need to leave, and everyone is waiting for me.
