It would be easier to go from Maxwell's equation (singular) to Maxwell's equations (plural) than to go the other way around. Here it is... After I combine some stuff. (By the way, $i = \hat{x} \hat{y} \hat{z}$ because it is $3d$.)

$$ \text{First, the differentials. There are two, to combine into the spacetime gradient, the partial derivitave with respect to time (} \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \text{), and the space gradient (} \vec{\nabla} \text{).}  $$

$$ \nabla F = J $$

$$ \text{actually,} $$

$$ \nabla F = \frac{J}{c \epsilon_0} $$

$$ \text{I said it that way so that it would look better.} $$
