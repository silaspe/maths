Ok, so, lambda calculus, I'll be following along with [the first part](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VQ382QG-y4), at least for now, and I haven't seen this in a year, so we'll be reacting to it together.

### Chapter $1$: Introduction

Ok, so, it looks like he's starting off with a function (written as $I$) that he calls "the identity". Now, what do you think $I(1)$ is? * Man in the backround says " same value! "*, and that is correct, $I(1) = 1$, $I(2) = 2$, what about $I(I)$? * No one awnsers*, yeah, it's $I$. (By the way, functions in lambda calculus are also called "combinators", each one has a function name (e.g. $I$), a more descriptive function name (e.g. identity), and an alias (which is always a bird for some reason) (e.g. Idiot bird.)) (Also by the way, I'll be copying what he's saying for the rest of this page, and putting my thoughts in between parenthases.) And then he uses some fancy notation " $\lambda a. a$ ". It takes in ($\lambda$) a value ($a$), and outputs ($.$) that same value ($a$). So, $I(x) = x$ for any $x$. As you saw, you can use functions as arguments (which is why they are called "combinators". Also, to me, this is the heart of lambda calculus), verbs are nouns and nouns are verbs. 

#### chapter $2$: What is this Lambda?

Ok, so, what was this $\lambda$ stuff from earlier? (Finally he explains it.) So, lambda is a signafier, it's a way to indicate that are starting the definition of a function. So, we can read this (this $\lambda a. a$) as: we're starting the definition of a function ($\lambda$), which takes a single input ($a$), or parameter (The $.$ signafies that we are no longer writing down the parameters, and now), and returns some expression ($a$). This whole thing is called a lambda abstraction in lambda calculus.

### chapter $3$: What is this Lambda Calculus?
