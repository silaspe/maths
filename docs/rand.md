That one puzzle

$$ \frac{\partial (x^2 + y^2)}{\partial (x + y)} = ? $$

$$ \text{Okay, fine, yes, that one was a joke. But it took me a whole weekend to solve it.} $$

$$ \text{Not that every day isn't a weekend for me, but I remember solving it on Sunday and posing it the day before.} $$

.

I might not work today (sad emoji)

... Because there is a science something, what was it again? Physics festival! So I am sad to say that, today, I will break my at least $1$ edit to my website per day rule... Wait! This text that I am writing counts as something, so I'll add this to my website. Anyways, I need to leave, and everyone is waiting for me.

.

Or today.

... That title and this text will be what I add to my website today.

This used to be a page on the website until I deleted it. The page still exists and you can find it by replacing the `rand` in the URL link above with `hyperbolic`, I think you can see why I deleted it.

One twig

One twig is a unit of distance, but first, y'know how one meter is one light second (the amount light traveles in one second) divided by $299,792,458$? Well, I was thinking: can't I just make a unit of measurement defined as one light second divided by $300,000,000$? Well, that would be decimal-centric! (I'd rather use binary.) So, I defined one twig (or one absolute unit) as one light second divided by $2^{30}$, so just under one foot, coming in at $10.99$ inches. Using twig-ic (I just came up with that name) is a lot like using metric (I was too lazy to invent an imperial like system (even though I'm 'murican) because I could only invent one unit), I was gonna use a binary based systen, but octal was better as it is closer to $10$ and is the amount of fingers on a cartoon character. If you divide a twig into $8$, you get $1$ unotwig, after that, $1$ duotwig, then $1$ triotwig, then $1$ quadtwig, then $1$ pentatwig, then $1$ hexatwig, then $1$ heptatwig, then $1$ octotwig, then $1$ nonatwig, then $1$ decatwig, then $1$ elatwig, but at that point, it is smaller than $1/10$'th of a nanometer, better stop there (also, the prefix is equal to the power of $8$ that you are dividing it by). If you want to get bigger units, add the prefix "nega", but when you get to one negaelatwig, it's the size of $8$ lightseconds. So yeah, that is the measurement system that I created last night.

It's snowing today!

Last time it snowed it didn't snow for very long and it didn't really stay. That was $2$ years ago. The last time it snowed before that (where it was actually a place I lived) was about $6$ years ago when I was $5$.
