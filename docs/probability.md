## to cheat, or not to cheat?

let's start with a game! The game is that you flip a coin 10 times and then you add the total number of heads and you want the most heads total, this game is preatty popular in some hypothetical town where there is a rumor going around that some pepole are using (somehow) using a weighted coin that has a $75$% chance of landing heads, the notation is $\frac{3}{4}$ chance, because what else (other than $100$) are you going to take a percent of? Anyways, this town has anominated you to be the detectave and test everyone with a test has all three of the properties:

1, false accusation: accuse less than $5$% of fair players

2, true accusation: accuse more than $80$% of cheaters

3, make it short: do as little coin flips as possible because we don't have all day

this is usualy where I solve the puzzle, but now's the chance to solve it yourself using the tools in the next chapter
