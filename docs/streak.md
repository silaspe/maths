# NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

let me explain, you know how I work on my website every day? I skipped yesterday. Other than that, I worked on the website every day for around $6$ months. Other than that, I'll use the "last time you hit commit" button to tell how long it's been.

It happened again, but this time, it was because I thought that I pushed the "commit button", when I did not. To be fair, 
I was on vacation, but at least, now I have an excuse to fix the typo where I spelled "every" as "everey".

It happened again.

It happened again on Oct $2$nd, but it's Oct $5$ as I am writing this.
