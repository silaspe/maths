## Complex numbers

$$ i = \sqrt{-1} $$

$$ a + bi = c + di \iff c = a, d = b $$

$$ (a + bi)(c + di) = ac + adi + bci + bdii = ac + adi + bci - bd = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i $$

$$ (a + bi)^2 = (aa - bb) + (ab + ab)i = (a^2 - b^2) + 2abi $$

$$ (a + bi)r = ar + bri $$

$$ ccong(a + bi) = a - bi $$

f is the definition of $sin(\theta)$

g is the definition of $cos(\theta)$

$\theta$ is the angle from the right of the x axis to the line h

now, I will define $f(x)$ as a function that takes in a real number and outputs a complex number that is $x$ radians around the unit circle, so like the geogebra file above, but in the complex plane. using the file we can say that $f(x) = cos(x) + isin(x)$, and any complex number $z$ has an angle $\theta$ measured in radians and a distance $r$ from the origin, so $z$ equals $rf(\theta)$, eccept pepole don't use $f(\theta)$ because there are other complex functions $f(z)$, and $rcos(x) + irsin(x)$ dosen't reach the high bar for perfection set by mathmeticians
